# Atlas

This Project was done as part of our Product Design Studio module at Singapore University of Design and Technology, partnering with Nika Planet.
 
Atlas is an innovative hybrid VTOL drone solution engineered to overcome real-world constraints in geospatial mapping missions. Designed for vertical takeoff and fixed-wing cruise, Atlas eliminates the need for traditional runway space while enhancing flight efficiency and data acquisition. With a focus on modularity, endurance, and adaptability, Atlas streamlines operations in constrained environmentsâ€”empowering teams with a smarter, more flexible approach to aerial intelligence.

### Problem Statement
How might we increase flight duration, while ensuring ease of launching and landing as well as portability for efficient geospatial data collection?

- VTOL drones are able to take off and land within constrained spaces but have low flight endurance
- fixed-wing drones are able to sustain longer flights but require a runway

In order to address these problems, we came up with Atlas as a solution.
